	  <h1>Elden Ring is Finally Here!</h1>
	  <p><em>March 3</em></p>
	  <p><img src="../images/elden_ring.jpg" width="200" alt="Elden Ring"/><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: large; font-family: gautreaux, sans-serif; font-weight: 700;">Last week on the 25th, </span>Elden Ring finally released. I've been patiently waiting for this game for the last year and now I'm finally playing it. I'm quite a number of hours into it at the time of writing this and I can already say with confidence that this is going to be the game of the year. In Elden Ring, you venture through a dark fantasy world, encountering friends, foes, and even demigods. Throughout your journey you'll find new armor, armaments, and in true RPG fashion you can allocate points into different stats like vigor, endurance, and intelligence, among others. Elden Ring received "universal acclaim" according to review aggregators Metacritic and OpenCritic. I'm very excited to continue playing and see what surprises the game has in store for me to discover.</p>

	  <h1>Exploring an Abandoned House</h1>
	  <p><em>February 20</em></p>
	  <p><img src="../images/abandoned_house.jpg" alt="abandoned house" width="250" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: large; font-family: gautreaux, sans-serif; font-weight: 700;">Yesterday my friends and I </span>explored an old abandoned house in Salisbury. Outside the house there were dilapidated wooden sheds with old rusty tools and equipment. When we stepped inside the house we saw that most of the furniture was destroyed. We were worried that the stairs would collapse when we walked up them. In one of the bedrooms we found a weird doll with a missing head. The house was fairly small and didn't have much inside, but it was still a fun experience. I look forward to exploring more cool and creepy places.</p>
